# QTM-347 Project

## Career Path Analysis and Prediction
This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze and predict career trajectories based on job history data.

## Goal of this Project
We want to provide a machine learning solution that helps identify the most likely next occupation or career move based on past experiences.

## Application & Motivation
- Why Transformer? A Transformer can model the full sequence of past jobs to predict the next role more accurately
- Better predictions could inform career-planning tools, HR systems, and personalized learning recommendations

## Pipeline
![Project Pipeline](docs/pipeline.png)

### Clustering Process:
- First stack job title vector with job description vector (vectors obtained using the sentence transformer)
- Second, we apply the K-Means clustering
- The optimized resulted is shown in the table below:
  
### Clustering Example:
| **Cluster id** | **Cluster Title**| **Example Job Titles**|
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 14             | Scientific Research and Natural Sciences       | anthropologist; astronomer; biochemical engineer; biochemist; ...|
| 29             | Education, Teaching, and Training Professionals| assistant lecturer; career guidance advisor; digital literacy teacher; drama teacher; driving instructor; ...|
| 0              | Finance and Business Consulting                | actuarial consultant; business coach; business consultant; business economics researcher; business manager; ...|
| ...            | ...                                            | ...                                                                                                        |


**Total Cluster Count: 33**, each containing around 25~50 related job titles

**Note:** The results above come from our transformer model. Please refer to the ``code`` section for code details. 

## Conclusion of our Experiment
- The transformer-based sequence model is effective for next-job prediction
- Achieves relatively accurate performance on core career categories
  
### Limitations:
- Data sparsity: Too many job categories will lower our prediction accuracy 
- K-Means clustering might lead to biases
- Randomness: Some people switch jobs not inconsistently, factors such as the economy and politics might influence oneâ€™s decision as well.
